# 🎄 Advent of Code – Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions for **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)**, the annual programming challenge held every December.  
Each day unlocks a new puzzle with two parts, and I am solving them daily and organizing the solutions here.


## 📁 Repository Structure

- Every folder represents a **year** of the competition (2025, 2024, ...).
- Each year's folder includes:
  - The puzzle input
  - My solution code for each day challenge

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

- To improve my problem-solving skills  
- To practice clean coding and algorithmic thinking  
- To track my progress publicly  
- To revisit and refactor solutions whenever needed

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pamidibindukumar/adventofcode.git
